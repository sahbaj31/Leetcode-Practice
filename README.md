# LeetCode Daily Practice üñ•Ô∏è  

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of solving LeetCode problems. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms in preparation for placements.  

## üìÖ Daily Plan  
- Solve at least one problem per day  
- Focus on Data Structures & Algorithms topics:  
  - Arrays  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Greedy Algorithms  
  - Recursion and Backtracking  

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure  
Each problem will be categorized by topic and difficulty level.
